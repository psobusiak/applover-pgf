Why exactly are these called <strong>Core</strong>? Because they represent how you can progress at your profession at Applover. Each core path covers all the things we're looking for from Applover's team members.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>Each development path is divided into several milestones to be achieved along with your progression. Particular milestone represents a set of exemplary behaviors and skills that need to be mastered to accomplish the milestone. Some of the paths share common skills and behaviors (e.g. all paths related to development roles: Android, iOS, Frontend, Backend, Wordpress) - as a result each milestone for these is composed of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development skills - exemplary development skills and behaviors common for all developers at Applover.</li>\n<li>Mastery - exemplary skills and behaviors directly related to particular area of expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And thus all development roles' paths share the same set of <strong>Development skills</strong> throughout their milestones while they contain unique set of <strong>Mastery</strong> skills.</p>\n<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Applover as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability as well as variety of soft skills.</li>\n<li>Your progression isn’t an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.</li>\n<li>This isn’t a checklist – PGF is a guide that helps you understand how you can progress at your work.</li>\n<li>PGF is a living organism - we will modify existing milestones or add new ones to the core paths whenever we need to do so.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/core/ios","title":"🍏 iOS","sidebarTitle":"🍏 iOS","sidebarGroup":"core","yaml":true,"levels":5,"homepage":true,"topics":[{"name":"development
